          Niket, lately I have been reading the Steve Jobs biography. And constantly, the author talks about Jobs' attention to detail and perseverance. The descriptions of those qualities remind me of you.
          </p>
          <p>
          But the thing about you is, you are also incredibly compassionate and loving. Everyone who meets you loves you forever. You bring out the best in people and also gather them together.
          </p>
          <p>
          So Niket, as a man with all of these awesome incredible attributes and talents, I just say, Party On. I look forward to many more long car ride talks, absurd website ideas, and general good times.
          </p>
          <p>
          Yours truly, Naf.

          Niket,
          </p>
          <p>
          I've said it once, and I'll say it again: Cancer ain't got shit on Niket Desai.  I've thought of you as a fighter for as long as I've known you.  I just had to think back to your first semester in Delta Chi.  I mean, pushing Will, a man twice your size, into a vending machine during your first week?  Climbing under the Bago to fix the dislodged battery that was leaking acid? (PS-- as long as your in the hospital, ask the doctors if they notice any lingering adverse effects from that battery acid).  Eating some of the fruity pebbles to get through I-week challenges more quickly?  You are one crazy and brave dude.  And you're an inspirational one; I'll tell you more about it in person, but you've had a big role in motivating me to make a huge upcoming life-change, which I need to thank you for.
          </p>
          <p>
          I really hope that this seemingly terrible dot connects somewhere amazing when you look back upon it.  And since it's Niket Desai's dot, I bet it will.  Stay hungry, stay foolish, right?
          </p>
          <p>
          Love you bud-- and I'll see you soon.

          HHHH to the IZZZZOOOOOO!!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
          HH I am jumping up and down (like how I do every time I see your beautiful face) sending you every ounce of strength, healing and crazy Ilana energy your way.  Words cannot even begin to express how proud of and inspired I am by you for having embraced this challenge with such courage, resilience, and determination.  You are the motivation for all of us to continue making every moment count, and have touched every single one of us in the most powerful of ways.  Ever since kindergarten, you truly have been the person I can always rely on to make magic happen, bring people together, and light up every room.  Now, more than ever, you are my source of inspiration, and are the reason that I keep doing everything I can to bring love into the world.  My family and I feel so blessed to have you in our lives, and you know you can count on us (especially papa bear) at any moment to provide you guidance and emotional support as you journey through this healing process.
          </p>

          As I promised H, I made you my first rap for the HH album... Thought I would share it with you before I come hope to perform it to you live. Let this bring you some laughs and some smiles... Love Love Love Love you H.
